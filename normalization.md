# Database Normalization Report â€“ ALX Airbnb Database

## Objective
Ensure the database schema is normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** by identifying and eliminating data redundancy and transitive dependencies.

## Normalization Steps

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
- Ensured **atomic fields** (no arrays, no repeating groups).
- All tables already comply with 1NF â€” fields like `location`, `role`, and `rating` are scalar.

**Result**: Pass

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
- All tables use **single-column primary keys** (UUIDs), so no risk of partial dependencies.
- Verified that every non-key field depends **entirely** on the primary key of the table.

**Result**: Pass

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Verified **no transitive dependencies**:
  - `Property â†’ Host â†’ User Info`: Resolved by using `host_id` as FK only.
  - `Booking â†’ Property â†’ Location` is valid as separate relationships, not duplicated.
  - `Review` and `Message` tables use FKs without duplicating sender/recipient info.

**Result**: Pass

---

## ðŸ”§ Adjustments Made

- Added constraints:
  - `CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)` to `Review`
  - `UNIQUE (user_id, property_id)` on `Review` to prevent duplicate reviews
  - `CHECK (end_date > start_date)` on `Booking` for date integrity

- Ensured enums for `role`, `status`, `payment_method` are clearly defined and constrained

- Separated concerns cleanly into individual tables without derived or duplicated fields.

---

## Final Result: Schema is in 3NF

The database schema avoids redundancy, supports integrity, and conforms fully to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
